      p Use Mithras to deploy and configure full-stack applications in AWS, with agentless setup and the flexibility and power of a Javascript configuration language.

      p Mithras focuses on AWS, making design choices that make simple AWS tasks easy, including features like explicit dependency declaration and idempotent operations.

      p Mithras presents a simplified interface, reducing the surface area of the AWS SDK to a digestible and easily managed size.

      p Standing on the shoulders of giants, Mithras provides a powerful server-side Javascript environment without callback hell. (We're looking at you, Node.)

      p Using brittle data languages such as YAML make customizing your configuration unecessarily convoluted. Mithras chooses a well-known and powerful language for descriving your AWS configurations: Javascript. You won't have to twist an unsuitable language to do what's needed for your configuration.

h2 Caveats

p Sounds pretty nifty, eh? But it's not perfect. If you need enterprise configuration management features, Mithras isn't a good choice. (Not yet, anyway.) If you have the need to manage hosts and resources outside AWS, Mithras probably isn't a good choice. If you love YAML, don't bother with Mithras.

p Finally, Mithras is new. It's currently alpha quality software, with bugs and design choices still being shaken out. Proceed with caution.
