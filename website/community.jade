h2 Contribute

p Mithras is open source, with the code available on GitHub. Contributions come in many shapes and sizes: we get excited to see people pitch in and help, whether it’s fixing a typo or discussing a feature you’d like to implement.

h2 Report a bug

p If you think you’ve found a bug, or something is not behaving as advertised, please report it. The best way to do that is open an issue on Github. IF you include what operating system you are running, the version of Mithras, and steps to reproduce the problem, then you are especially awesome.

h2 Help improve the docs

p If something in the docs is wrong, confusing or just doesn't make sense, please let us know by opening an issue and we will do our best to fix it. If you have an idea for a guide, tutorial or screen cast please send it to @MithrasCM.

h2 Discuss and open a pull request

p If you want to jump in and start writing code, that is fantastic. We welcome these commits, too.

p If you want to add a new feature, one of the maintainers would love to chat with you first to make sure the feature is inline with the project philosophy and design goals. We value your time and just want to resolve any concerns right away. Feel free to open an issue.

h2 Mailing list

p Join us on the Mithras 
  a(href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mithras-config-management") mailing list 
  to to discuss your use of Mithras.
